# Seam-carving
Seam Carving is a Python-based tool for content-aware image resizing and object removal. It uses energy maps and seam manipulation to resize images while preserving important content. Supports protection masks and object removal.
Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing

This project implements a seam carving algorithm for intelligent image resizing and object removal. Seam carving is a technique that resizes images by removing or inserting seamsâ€”paths of least importanceâ€”while preserving the image's key content. This implementation supports resizing with optional protection masks and object removal using energy maps and forward/backward cumulative energy calculations.
